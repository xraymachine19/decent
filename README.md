# decent.less

A Less library for smarter component styling


## Setup and testing

1. Run 'python -m SimpleHTTPServer' in the decent directory.
2. Follow the directions there (or just go to localhost:8000)
3. Edit index.html or the less, then refresh to test stuff.
4. index.html isn't the public splash page for github but you can put that kinda content there if you'd like. It's really just a scratchpad. Test-style setups (gray-scale contrasting table for example) are good here too.


## Compiling the Less

1. Run 'lessc index.less css/index.css'.
