        <p>You'll be writing Decent CSS in no time.</p>

          <h1 class="code-line" data-line-start=2 data-line-end=3><a id="First_know_Less_2"></a>First, know Less</h1>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="4" data-line-end="5">If you don’t know Less, the preprocessor for CSS, you should. Decent is written in Less.</p>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="6" data-line-end="7">Here’s a quick tutorial if you don’t know it.</p>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="8" data-line-end="9">Variables look like this:</p>
          <pre><code><span class="">p</span> {
    <span class="">@variable-name</span>: #000000;
    <span class="">color</span>: <span class="">@variable-name</span>;
}</code></pre>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="15" data-line-end="16">They’re set with the @ symbol. The above outputs:</p>
          <pre><code>p { color: #000000;}</code></pre>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="19" data-line-end="20">Next, you can nest rules inside of each other:</p>
          <pre><code>p {
    @variable-name: #ffffff;
    span { 
        color: @variable-name;
    }
}</code></pre>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="28" data-line-end="29">This lets you quickly write and organize rules in a codebase. The above outputs:</p>
          <pre><code>p span { color: #ffffff;}</code></pre>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="32" data-line-end="33">There you go! That covers about 90% of the Less you will ever write. It has tons and tons great features besides these, though, and great docs to go with it. But if you know CSS and the above, then you know Less. Welcome to the club!</p>

<section> 
          <h1 class="code-line" data-line-start=35 data-line-end=36><a id="Wait_what_about_Sass_35"></a>Wait, what about Sass?</h1>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="37" data-line-end="38">We get it. A lot of people “moved on” to Sass.</p>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="39" data-line-end="40">We didn’t. And here’s why: Less is declarative and Sass is imperative.</p>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="41" data-line-end="42">Some people see Sass and think, “Great, a handy imperative layer in which to write and output code!”</p>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="43" data-line-end="44">We get that too. We’re just not those people. Generally, this group of people is looking to <em>not</em> write CSS. We even love that, in spirit. The best line of code is the line of code you don’t have to write.</p>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="45" data-line-end="46">But sometimes you do have to write and organize a whole lot of CSS into one codebase with variable outputs, different windows into your app’s UI world.</p>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="47" data-line-end="48">For this, we find Less’s declarative nature and lazy loading to be the optimal solution. We think of the imperative layer as constantly geting in our way. Less enhances and celebrates CSS. It doesn’t apologize for its declarative nature.</p>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="49" data-line-end="50">Still, if you know Sass, then you can use Decent pretty comfortably. The tutorial above covers most of the daily use difference. Just pretend you’re tweeting!</p>

          <h1 class="code-line" data-line-start=51 data-line-end=52><a id="Seriously_though_No_Sass_51"></a>Seriously, though. No Sass?</h1>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="53" data-line-end="54">No Sass. We’ve heard the features argument. It’s more about the paradigm for us.</p>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="55" data-line-end="56">If you want an example, check out this codepen. One of the two examples will make sense to you. If the boxes are green, you must go lean! (…er stylesheets)</p>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="57" data-line-end="58">If you’re constantly fighting to namespace components and cart around CSS in Javascript, you might be downstream of this problem. Decent lets you build a modern UI style codebase with centralized style controls and easy support for building multiple app/experience/portal targets.</p>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="59" data-line-end="60">A single Decent codebase can put out consistent looks/stylesheets for your web app, your Electron app, your marketing page and your Myspace widget (or more recent technology). All without running into those weird global scope issues as the codebase gets more complex. All without walking on eggshells around that global scope after being tortured by Kafkaesque errors.</p>
        </section>
        <section> 
          
          <h1 class="code-line" data-line-start=61 data-line-end=62><a id="How_do_I_get_started_61"></a>How do I get started?</h1>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="63" data-line-end="64">First, you should have some sort of web page to look at. It can be an <em>index.html</em> file on your desktop. Or a Django app running in the cloud. We really like Sitepoint’s starting point because we’re copy/paste bandits: <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/a-basic-html5-template/">https://www.sitepoint.com/a-basic-html5-template/</a></p>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="65" data-line-end="66">Take note of where it links to the CSS: <strong>styles.css</strong> is your stylesheet target.</p>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="67" data-line-end="68">Don’t write anything in there. You don’t edit CSS files now. You are writing in the Decent way now.</p>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="69" data-line-end="70">Replace the <strong>&lt;body&gt;</strong> element with this (no, we won’t need that scripts file&mdash; Decent is <em>not</em> a Javascript library):</p>
          <pre><code>&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;main&gt;
        &lt;section&gt;
        &lt;/section&gt;
    &lt;/main&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;</code></pre>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="78" data-line-end="79">Out of the box, Decent uses main, section and nav as high-level organizational elements. We’ll write our demo HTML in that section element.</p>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="80" data-line-end="81">Second, you need a way to look at this webpage. If you need something quick, we recommend:</p>
          <pre><code class="terminal">python -m SimpleHTTPServer</code></pre>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="84" data-line-end="85">That’ll serve your <strong>index.html</strong> file locally, acting like a real website, provided you run it in the same folder (the desktop folder, in the example above). You might need to install python.</p>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="86" data-line-end="87">Next, we’ll need NPM and Less. Decent is the thing that runs your CSS codebase. Decent runs on Less which runs in NPM. It’s less complicated than it sounds. Just run:</p>
          <pre><code class="terminal">npm install -g less</code></pre>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="90" data-line-end="91">That installs Less globally, meaning you can run it in any directory. You want to do that because Less runs on your machine, and not so much as a featured package on your site. Your site only shows the compiled results of Less. (The exception here might be less.js. We don’t recommend using less.js with Decent.)</p>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="92" data-line-end="93">If you don’t have NPM, get it here: <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm">https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm</a></p>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="94" data-line-end="95">It’s worth it! Even if you only ever use it for Less.</p>
        </section>

          <h1 class="code-line" data-line-start=96 data-line-end=97><a id="A_simple_workflow_96"></a>A simple workflow</h1>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="98" data-line-end="99">If you’re following along with the above, your directory structure might look like this:</p>
          <p class="has-line-data ascii" data-line-start="100" data-line-end="103">project-name<br>
          ├── index.html<br>
          └── styles.css</p>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="104" data-line-end="105">If you’re using a more complicated setup, you can probably extrapolate from this demo. Less integrates well with command-line based workflows and has desktop solutions too.</p>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="106" data-line-end="107">Changes to both files will be reflected on <a href="http://localhost:8000/">http://localhost:8000/</a> whenever we make them and refresh. So where do we put Decent?</p>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="108" data-line-end="109">The answer: Anywhere you’d like! It works best right in the root directory of the site.</p>
          <p class="has-line-data ascii" data-line-start="110" data-line-end="116">project-name<br>
          ├── decent<br>
          │ ├── index.less<br>
          │ └── (many, many other files)<br>
          ├── index.html<br>
          └── styles.css</p>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="117" data-line-end="118">At this point, you may want to change the name of the ‘decent’ folder into something more sensible, like ‘less’:</p>
          <p class="has-line-data ascii" data-line-start="119" data-line-end="125">project-name<br>
          ├── less<br>
          │ ├── index.less<br>
          │ └── (many, many other files)<br>
          ├── index.html<br>
          └── styles.css</p>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="126" data-line-end="127">In this way, Decent <em>is</em> your CSS/Less codebase. Or at least the start of your codebase.</p>
          
        </section>
        <section> 
          
          <h1 class="code-line" data-line-start=128 data-line-end=129><a id="Wait_cant_I_just_grab_the_node_package_and_import_128"></a>Wait, can’t I just grab the node package and import?</h1>
          <p class="warning">This section is a little advanced. To continue with the directory building in the simple tutorial, click here.</p>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="132" data-line-end="133">You can! We recommend using Decent in the above way, as a downloaded and bootstrapped CSS codebase starting point.</p>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="134" data-line-end="135">But you can also grab the Node package and import it in your Less codebase. Decent files are all designed to be able to be imported on their own, with their own dependencies stated inside their file.</p>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="136" data-line-end="137">Want Decent’s awesome contrasting superpowers but nothing else? Try:</p>
          <pre><code>@import &quot;node/directory/decent/mixins/contrast.less&quot;;</code></pre>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="140" data-line-end="141">Importing the entire library can be a little risky. Decent is meant as an environment, and may have problems sharing the stage in this capacity.</p>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="142" data-line-end="143">When it came to easy variable names or the sanctity of the scope, we picked the easy variable names every single time.</p>
          <p>The "golden path" install is installing with node, then <strong>copying the folder over</strong> to serve as your codebase. That way you have a local copy of the original files, along with access to Decent's node dependencies and component imports. (You may need to change the @node_dir variable)</p>

          <h1 class="code-line" data-line-start=144 data-line-end=145><a id="Lets_run_this_thing_144"></a>Let’s run this thing!</h1>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="146" data-line-end="147">Where were we? We had just put together our basic directory structure:</p>
          <p class="has-line-data ascii" data-line-start="148" data-line-end="154">project-name<br>
          ├── less<br>
          │ ├── index.less<br>
          │ └── (many, many other files)<br>
          ├── index.html<br>
          └── styles.css</p>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="155" data-line-end="156">Where do we start with the actual styling? Let’s imagine we want to write this rule:</p>
          <pre><code>p { border: 2px dashed red;}</code></pre>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="159" data-line-end="160">In CSS, we start writing the rule. In Less, we start writing the rule.</p>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="161" data-line-end="162">In Decent, we <em>add the rule</em> to the p definition already in <code>elements/p.less</code>:</p>
          <p class="has-line-data ascii" data-line-start="163" data-line-end="172">project-name<br>
          ├── less<br>
          │ ├── index.less<br>
          │ ├── (many, many other files)<br>
          │ └── elements<br>
          │ &nbsp; ├── <strong>p.less</strong><br>
          │ &nbsp; └── (other elements)<br>
          ├── index.html<br>
          └── styles.css</p>
          <p class="info"><strong>It's quicker and easier!</strong> If you're in Sublime, Atom or VS Code, you can use <strong>ctrl/cmd + P</strong> and type "p.less" to get to the file quickly.</p>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="173" data-line-end="174">This happens because Decent makes it so that your website <strong>supports all HTML</strong>. All HTML elements have their own file and represenation in Decent. HTML support isn’t a weird feature for Decent to have; it’s a weird feature for most sites to be lacking.</p>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="175" data-line-end="176">Workflow-wise, this means finding “p.less” through your IDE and editing the lone rule within the file, instead of scrolling through one big file looking for one rule among dozens.</p>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="177" data-line-end="178">For everything outside of HTML elements, we can add rules in the traditional way. For the demo purposes, we can write new rules at the end of <strong>index.less</strong>. Writing rules here gives us easy control over the variable environment. Lazy loading uses the definitions it finds last, so writing Less here is kinda like having “the high ground.”</p>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="179" data-line-end="180">We might write this rule at the end of index.less, after all the import statements, instead of the paragraph rule:</p>
          <pre><code>.offer-frame { border: 2px dashed red;}</code></pre>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="183" data-line-end="184">Now our .offer-frame component (or whatever it is) has the border rule. How do we get it to show up? First let’s make sure it’s in our index.html in the section inside body:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;p class=&quot;offer-frame&quot;&gt;
    20% off compile times!
&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="187" data-line-end="188">It won’t show up if it’s not there, right? Then let’s compile the rules for how it looks using Less.</p>
          
        </section>
        <section> 
          
          <h1 class="code-line" data-line-start=189 data-line-end=190><a id="Compiling_the_Less_189"></a>Compiling the Less</h1>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="191" data-line-end="192">To compile our Less, we need to be in our terminal in the site’s root directory, which here is “project-name.” Look, all the best frameworks are boring. Bear with us.</p>
          <p class="has-line-data ascii" data-line-start="193" data-line-end="199">project-name<br>
          ├── less<br>
          │ ├── index.less<br>
          │ └── (many, many other files)<br>
          ├── index.html<br>
          └── styles.css</p>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="200" data-line-end="201">To compile here, the command is:</p>
          <pre><code>lessc less/index.less styles.css</code></pre>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="204" data-line-end="205">No, that’s not a typo. It’s <code>lessc</code> in the command line. This will compile the CSS and report back on whether it was a success or a failure. If it’s a failure, we’ll get a hint as to why. If it’s a success, we’re ready to look at the changes.</p>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="206" data-line-end="207">Going back to <a href="http://localhost:8000/">http://localhost:8000/</a>, we should see our new dashed red border line on the offer component.</p>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="208" data-line-end="209">Now that it’s there and working, let’s make it official. To do that, we might add a ‘components’ directory as a sibling of the ‘elements’ directory, with an ‘offer-frame.less’ file in there. Then we’d import <em>that</em> in index.less instead of just writing the rules right there.</p>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="210" data-line-end="211">Or we could just leave it where it is. It’s just a demo. In general though, the above pattern is recommended, specfically a ‘components’ directory and a ‘pages’ directory. We urge you to do this now, just as an exercise, to get comfortable editing your Less codebase. Which is what Decent is as soon as you copy it over.</p>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="212" data-line-end="213">Since a barebones approach is better for many projects, and since the tech world has so so many names for “components” and “pages,” we decided to leave that bit of directorial prescriptiveness out.</p>

        <section> 
          <h1 class="code-line" data-line-start=214 data-line-end=215><a id="Writing_Less_the_Decent_way_214"></a>Writing Less the Decent way</h1>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="216" data-line-end="217">Let’s edit .offer-frame.</p>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="218" data-line-end="219">Let’s give it a red background:</p>
          <pre><code>.offer-frame { 
    border: 2px dashed red;
    background: red;
}</code></pre>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="225" data-line-end="226">Compile with <code>lessc</code> and see the red background. There are two problems here, both of which we will solve the Decent way.</p>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="227" data-line-end="228">First, let’s get the text contrast up to standards.</p>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="229" data-line-end="230">We could write out something like <code>color: white;</code> or we could find something that worked well with the design. Or we could just automate all of that as a part of our project settings (This is what Decent does).</p>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="231" data-line-end="232">How do we know what color some text is, anyway? If the designer looked up the contrast numbers, then the designer wasted his time. If the developer looked up the contrast numbers, then the developer wasted her time. Instead, use Decent to establish a contrast standard along with a tinting/shading strategy unique to your project.</p>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="233" data-line-end="234">To do this, we use the <strong>.contrast()</strong> mixin to programmatically find the best text color given the CSS property and background color as an argument. It takes no time at all (except, well, compile time) and provides perfect consistency (which we can adjust later!) across a project.</p>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="235" data-line-end="236">So here we can write:</p>
          <pre><code>.offer-frame { 
    border: 2px dashed red;
    background: red;
    <strong>.contrast(red);</strong>
}</code></pre>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="243" data-line-end="244">This will output a color that meets our site’s default contrast standard. Speaking of which, Decent has a whole bunch of defaults. One of them will be good for the problem we see on refresh: The .offer-frame paragraph has no padding.</p>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="245" data-line-end="246">Naturally, we add this in:</p>
          <pre><code>.offer-frame { 
    border: 2px dashed red;
    background: red;
    .contrast(red);
    <strong>padding:</strong> 
}</code></pre>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="254" data-line-end="255">But what comes next? What do we set the padding to? We set it to the <em>default</em> padding, which is set at the project level. But how do we express that? In CSS, it’s maybe not so straightforward. In Decent, it looks like this:</p>
          <pre><code>.offer-frame { 
    border: 2px dashed red;
    background: red;
    .contrast(red);
    <strong>.default(padding);</strong>
}</code></pre>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="263" data-line-end="264">Ultimately, this ‘padding’ reference goes back to Decent’s <strong>properties.less</strong> file which contains default variable counterparts for every single CSS property, meaning <strong>.default()</strong> can be used with <em>any</em> CSS property. There are no eggshells here. Decent unapologetically puts a lot of variables into the global scope. .default(border), .default(margin), .default(box-shadow) will all output rules assigning those CSS properties to those same-named Less variable values.</p>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="265" data-line-end="266">When transplanted to another app, .offer-frame will play by that app's rules, using that app’s default padding. This idea of transplantability is a core theme in Decent, which targets the decentralized web. A shared precompile styling environment lets the sites of the next Internet share parts as needed without looking ridiculous. (Don’t worry, it works with the "Legacy Internet" too.)</p>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="267" data-line-end="268">Enough of the ideals. Let’s clean up .offer-frame a bit.</p>

          <h1 class="code-line" data-line-start=269 data-line-end=270><a id="Color_and_meaning_269"></a>Color and meaning</h1>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="271" data-line-end="272">Generally @color is used to represent what color something is.</p>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="273" data-line-end="274">It’s not, as implied above, the default value for “color:” the CSS property. It’s the only exception, because we shouldn’t be writing “color:” in our code.</p>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="275" data-line-end="276">So let’s set that red background to a variable:</p>
          <pre><code>.offer-frame { 
    @color: red;
    border: 2px dashed @color;
    background: @color;
    .contrast(@color);
    <strong>.default(padding);</strong>
}</code></pre>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="285" data-line-end="286">Now it has padding, the text is properly contrasted, and it even has that neat border.</p>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="287" data-line-end="288">The problem now is that, in most themes and applications, red (the CSS color) is just a bit too much.</p>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="289" data-line-end="290">There’s a less obvious problem: Red means something to us. But it doesn’t necessarily mean something in general.</p>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="291" data-line-end="292">Project-wide meaning is a hard thing to nail down, especially in a visual design sense. To remedy this, Decent ships with ten semantic colors, all of which convey some sort of meaning. Here, we’ll convey meaning through the variable <strong>@failure</strong>, which is always red.</p>
          <pre><code>.offer-frame { 
    @color: @failure;
    border: 2px dashed @color;
    background: @color;
    .contrast(@color);
    <strong>.default(padding);</strong>
}</code></pre>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="301" data-line-end="302">Notice that the contrast adjusts to the new color. If we changed it to <strong>@success</strong>, which is always green, the text contrast would still just work. Try ‘white’ and ‘black’ too.</p>
          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="303" data-line-end="304">Note also that the semantic colors in your codebase are all downstream of the <strong>@base-color</strong> variable. This variable should be something like your “brand color” or main color of the project. There are as many sets of semantic colors as there are input values.</p>

          <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="307" data-line-end="308">Your .offer-frame may not seem impressive on its own, but let’s review what you’ve done here:</p>

          <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="311" data-line-end="312">You gave something semantic meaning through color</li>
          <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="312" data-line-end="313">You implemented and wieled project-wide defaults</li>
          <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="313" data-line-end="314">You learned how to not worry about text contrast</li>
