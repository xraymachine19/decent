                <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="37" data-line-end="38">We get it. A lot of people “moved on” to Sass.</p>
                <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="39" data-line-end="40">We didn’t. And here’s why: Less is declarative and Sass is imperative.</p>
                <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="41" data-line-end="42">Some people see Sass and think, “Great, a handy imperative layer in which to write and output code!”</p>
                <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="43" data-line-end="44">We get that too. We’re just not those people. Generally, this group of people is looking to <em>not</em> write CSS. We even love that, in spirit. The best line of code is the line of code you don’t have to write.</p>
                <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="45" data-line-end="46">But sometimes you do have to write and organize a whole lot of CSS into one codebase with variable outputs, different windows into your app’s UI world.</p>
                <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="47" data-line-end="48">For this, we find Less’s declarative nature and lazy loading to be the optimal solution. We think of the imperative layer as constantly getting in our way. Less enhances and celebrates CSS. It doesn’t apologize for its declarative nature.</p>
                <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="49" data-line-end="50">Still, if you know Sass, then you can use Decent pretty comfortably. Just use @ instead of $ and 90% of it just works.</p>

                <h1 class="code-line" data-line-start=51 data-line-end=52><a id="Seriously_though_No_Sass_51"></a>Seriously, though. No Sass?</h1>
                <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="53" data-line-end="54">No Sass. We’ve heard the features argument. It’s more about the paradigm for us.</p>
                <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="55" data-line-end="56">If you want an example, check out this codepen. One of the two examples will make sense to you. If the boxes are green, you must go lean! (…er stylesheets)</p>
                <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="57" data-line-end="58">If you’re constantly fighting to namespace components and cart around CSS in Javascript, you might be downstream of this problem. Decent lets you build a modern UI style codebase with centralized style controls and easy support for building multiple app/experience/portal targets.</p>
                <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="59" data-line-end="60">A single Decent codebase can put out consistent looks/stylesheets for your web app, your Electron app, your marketing page and your Myspace widget (or more recent technology). All without running into those weird global scope issues as the codebase gets more complex. All without walking on eggshells around that global scope after being tortured by Kafkaesque errors.</p>
